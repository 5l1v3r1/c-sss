	@bug Sometimes there is an error properly extracting the secret
	from the shares, but I can't track down the cause. It's not clear if
	it's related to the random number generator.  It seems to happen more
	often with secrets that consist of complex UTF-8 characters (e.g.
	`Ã¼`). Rerunning the same keys will then most likely give the correct
	answer the next time. On some secret/key combinations, the failure seems
	to occur roughly 10% of the time.
